# FDTD Simulation File for Materials Advances Submission

This repository contains a representative finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)
simulation file associated with a perovskite light-emitting diode (PeLED) study
based on the lead-free copper halide perovskite Cs₃Cu₂X₅ (X = Cl, Br, I).

## Contents
- A representative ANSYS Lumerical FDTD project file (.fsp) containing:
  - PeLED layer stack
  - Cs₃Cu₂X₅ emissive layer
  - Dipole source configuration
  - Optical monitors used for emission analysis

## Notes
- The provided .fsp file is intended to demonstrate the simulation methodology,
  geometry setup, and parameter choices used in the study.
- Raw time-domain field data and full simulation outputs are not included due to
  file size and software-specific constraints.
- Only a representative configuration is shared; additional halide compositions
  discussed in the manuscript are not included.
- Additional data may be obtained from the corresponding author upon reasonable
  request.
