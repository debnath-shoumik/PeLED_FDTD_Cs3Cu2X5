FDTD Simulation Run Notes
========================

This document summarizes the key simulation settings used in the
finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations reported in the associated
manuscript on Cs₃Cu₂X₅-based perovskite light-emitting diodes.

Software
--------
ANSYS Lumerical FDTD Solutions

Simulation File
---------------
- File type: .fsp (Lumerical FDTD project file)
- The .fsp file contains the complete simulation setup, including geometry,
  sources, monitors, mesh settings, and boundary conditions.

Simulation Type
---------------
3D FDTD simulation of a perovskite LED (PeLED) employing the lead-free copper
halide perovskite Cs₃Cu₂X₅ (X = Cl, Br, or I) as the emissive layer.

Geometry Overview
-----------------
- Substrate and electrodes
- Electron transport layer (ETL)
- Cs₃Cu₂X₅ emissive layer
- Hole transport layer (HTL)

The representative device geometry is fully defined within the provided .fsp file.

Source Definition
-----------------
- Electric dipole source
- Emission wavelength range: Visible (as reported in the manuscript)
- Dipole orientations: In-plane and out-of-plane configurations
- Dipole location: Within the Cs₃Cu₂X₅ emissive layer

Boundary Conditions
-------------------
- Lateral directions: Periodic boundary conditions
- Vertical direction: Perfectly matched layers (PML)

Mesh Settings
-------------
- Non-uniform mesh
- Local mesh refinement applied around the emissive region
- Coarser mesh used elsewhere to reduce computational cost

Monitors
--------
- Power monitors for radiated power calculation
- Near-field monitors for electric field distribution
- Far-field projection monitor for light extraction efficiency (LEE)
- Normalization monitors for emission enhancement analysis

Simulation Outputs
------------------
- Emission enhancement metrics
- Light extraction efficiency (LEE)
- Near-field electric field distributions
- Far-field radiation patterns

Notes
-----
- Raw field data and time-domain monitor outputs are not included in this
  repository due to data size and software-specific constraints.
- The shared .fsp file represents a reproducible reference configuration
  illustrating the simulation methodology used in this work.
- Additional information and data can be obtained from the corresponding
  author upon reasonable request.
